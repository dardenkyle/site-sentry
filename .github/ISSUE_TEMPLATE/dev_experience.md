## Problem

Whatâ€™s inconsistent or missing in local DX / CI?

## Proposal

Describe the improvement (e.g., add pre-commit hooks, standardize Python 3.13, add Makefile).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pre-commit runs Ruff lint/format and Mypy
- [ ] Makefile or tasks.ps1 includes test/lint/type/fmt
- [ ] CI reflects consistent environment
- [ ] Documentation updated
